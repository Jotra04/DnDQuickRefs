\item This unconsciousness stops upon regaining hitpoints
\end{itemize}
\section{Death saves \small (PHB p.197)}
When you start your turn with 0 hitpoints, you make a death save
\begin{itemize}
\item Roll a D20, if the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed, otherwise you fail
\item These death saves use no modifiers and do not gain advantage or disadvantage
\item When you roll a 1, it counts as 2 failures
\item When you roll a 20, you regain 1 hitpoint and stop making death saves
\item Any damage you take while having 0 hitpoints counts as a fail, a critical hit counts as 2 failures.
\item Taking damage equal or greater than your hitpoint maximum while having 0 hitpoints causes instant death.
\item Keep track of your successes and failures
	\begin{itemize}
	\item On 3 successes, you become stable
	\item On 3 failures, you die
	\item This count resets upon stabilizing or regaining hitpoints
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
